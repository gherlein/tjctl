This is a simple utility to configure and tweak a TigerJet 560 based USB
to FXS device.

It's intended to be used in conjuction with the in kernel USB audio
driver; load the "audio" module and it will create a /dev oss style
device node (/dev/dsp1 for me as I have a normal soundcard on /dev/dsp).
You then need to do:

tjctl init

to initialise the device.

Once that's done you can call:

tjctl gethook

to determine if the phone is on or off hook.

tjctl ring

will make the phone ring (it stops once picked up, or "tjctl noring"
will stop it).

This utility was written by Jonathan McDowell <noodles@earth.li> and is
largely based on the tjusb kernel driver, which can be found at:

but it doesn't appear to support the sending of audio over the device
node.
